;;; Commentary:

;; Internal deletion support for removing persisted Codex threads by reaching
;; into the current CODEX_HOME storage layout.  This is intentionally isolated
;; from the rest of codex-ide because it depends on Codex implementation
;; details rather than a supported app-server API.

primarily uses the public app-server API.  If Codex adds an officially
supported thread deletion API, this implementation should be replaced to use
that instead.

If a live session buffer is attached to THREAD-ID, prompt before tearing down
that session and then remove the persisted thread data from disk."
